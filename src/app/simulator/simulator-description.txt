Description of the toy-simulator:

Here we imagine: 
. Simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
. There are no other obstructions on the table surface.
. The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be prevented from falling to destruction. 
. Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed.

. Application support commands of the following form -
  PLACE X,Y,F  (F= facing)
  MOVE
  LEFT
  RIGHT
  REPORT
. PLACE - put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST.
. MOVE - will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.
. LEFT and RIGHT - will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction without changing the
  position of the robot.
. REPORT - will announce the current X,Y and F of the robot.
. Considering (0,0) as origin which can be considered - SOUTH WEST most corner.
. PLACE command- is the first valid command, after that, any sequence of commands
  may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE command. 
. The application discard all commands in the sequence until a valid PLACE command has been executed.
. A robot that is not on the table can choose the ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT and REPORT commands.
